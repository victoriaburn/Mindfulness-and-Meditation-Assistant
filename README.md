# Mindfulness and Meditation Bash Script

This script is designed to guide you through a mindfulness and meditation session. It uses the `spd-say` command to provide audio instructions and the `sleep` command to pause for specified durations.

## How to Use

1. Run the script in your terminal. A welcome message will be spoken.

2. You will be prompted to enter the duration (in seconds) for each part of the breathing exercises. Enter a number and press Enter.

3. The script will guide you through 5 rounds of breathing exercises, each consisting of inhaling, holding your breath, and exhaling. Each part will last for the duration you specified.

4. You will be prompted to enter the duration (in seconds) for the mindfulness exercise. Enter a number and press Enter.

5. The script will guide you through a mindfulness exercise, asking you to focus on your breath.

6. You will be asked if you would like a guided meditation. If you enter "yes", the script will guide you through a visualization exercise. If you enter "no", the script will skip this step.

7. You will be prompted to enter the duration (in seconds) for the reflection time. Enter a number and press Enter.

8. The script will guide you through a reflection exercise, asking you to think about your day.

9. A conclusion message will be spoken, and the script will exit.

## Requirements

This script requires the `spd-say` command, which is used to convert text to speech. If you do not have `spd-say` installed, you can install it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install speech-dispatcher
```

## Notes

This script is intended to be a simple tool for mindfulness and meditation. It does not replace professional guidance or therapy. Always listen to your body and mind, and do what feels right for you.
